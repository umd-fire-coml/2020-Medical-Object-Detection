This repository contains a neural network that is able to detect melanoma, a serious type of skin cancer.

This type of cancer can be easily confused with skin discoloration, so being able to notice what is skin cancer and benign skin discoloration is extremely important.

As seen in the above images, melanoma can be extremely difficult to detect just based off of the human eye, so machine learning can provide an essential tool to help detect a life-threatening disease.

Below is a Google Drive link to the dataset:
